I teach R to graduate students and faculty members at national bird conferences. This page contains links to my teaching lessons I've put online. Expect past lessons to be added intermitently. 

### Advanced R workshops
My colleague and I, Auriel Fournier, have taught an advanced R workshop three years in a row now at AOS/AOU.  
These lessons are free for anyone to download:

### R challenges written for the UDel R club.  
In collaboration with Desiree Narango, we created the R club to help students with R and answer questions. For this I wrote a couple of 
R challenges to help students learn more about problem solving in R. You can download lessons and answers
