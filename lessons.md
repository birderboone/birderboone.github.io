I teach R to graduate students and faculty members at national bird conferences. This page will be filled with my coding lessons I've made for either this site or for our R workshop. Currently here is the [link](https://github.com/aurielfournier/AOS18AZ) to our lessons being to in 2018 at AOS Tucson, AZ

Stay tuned for this page to grow with personal lessons I made that span more than just what we teach in our workshops.
