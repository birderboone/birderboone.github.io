I teach R to graduate students and faculty members at national bird conferences. This page contains links to my teaching lessons I've put online. Expect past lessons to be added intermitently. 

### Advanced R workshops
My colleague and I, Auriel Fournier, have taught an advanced R workshop three years in a row now at AOS/AOU.  
These lessons are free for anyone to download:

[AOS Workshop](https://github.com/aurielfournier/AOS18AZ) includes our lessons for 2018 at AOS Tucson, AZ

### R challenges written for the UDel R club.  
UDel PhD student, Desiree Narango, and I formed the R club to help students with R and answer questions. For this I wrote a couple of 
R challenges to help students learn more about problem solving in R. You can download lessons and answers

### Links to great lessons
- *Creating packages* is a great lesson for moderate and advanced R users for sharing code and packaging together commonly used functions for daily use. Hillary Parker at Not So Standard Deviations makes a useful and quick write up on [package writing](https://hilaryparker.com/2014/04/29/writing-an-r-package-from-scratch/)
