### More Information
My name is Matt Boone. I am an ecologist with an interest in developing software tools for conservation groups and teaching scientists the programming. I specialize in R, GIS, bash/bin, and am currently learning Python and Java.

I have 8 years of field experience working primarily with birds. I earned my Masters of Science in 2016 from the University of Delaware with a degree in Wildlife Ecology. In my masters I used weather radar technology to study the migration and stopover of birds. From this I gained an intense understanding of the statistical progamming language R.  

I am passionate about building products for scientists that increase their effeciency with data collection and analysis. I have built R packages for analyzing radar data, systems to download and manage image and sound files effeciently, databases for non-profits, and teach R workshops at national bird conferences.

My github repository is [birderboone](https://github.com/birderboone)
