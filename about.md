### More Information
My name is Matt Boone. I am an ecologist with an interest in developing software tools for conservation groups and teaching scientists the programming. I specialize in R, GIS, bash/bin, and am learning Python and Java.

I have 8 years of field experience working primarily with birds. I earned my Masters of Science in 2016 from the University of Delaware with a degree in Wildlife Ecology studying aeroecology using weather radar technology. During my masters I gained an intense understanding of the statistical progamming language R. This developed quickly into a passion for building products in R for scientists to use to increase their effeciency with their data. I have built R packages for analyzing radar data, built systems to download and manage image and sound files effeciently, built databases for non-profits, and teach R workshops at national bird conferences.
