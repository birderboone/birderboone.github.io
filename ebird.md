# Texas Filters Widget 
Texas contains 254 counties that host over 500 bird species annually spanning desert, alpine, shrubland, coastal, and riparian wetland habitats. The international birding portal eBird, hires dozens of volunteers for the state of Texas to maintain filters for each county in order to maintain data integrity. The task of creating accurate filters for each of the 254 counties in Texas is extremely difficult to do particularly in counties with little data.  

With the help of head Texas eBird editor, Eric Carpenter, I created a tool that uses the current filters and presence absence data from eBird to visualize and monitor these filters for the Texas eBird portal.  

This tool currently runs in a SHINY R app that can be run locally on a computer. Just download the entire folder below. Instal the necessary packages (noted at the top of the code), and hit run.
