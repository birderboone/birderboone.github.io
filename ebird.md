As a regional editor for central Texas and a data junky I have worked significantly with eBird data in my free time. 

# Texas Filters Widget 
Texas contains 254 counties that host over 500 bird species annually spanning desert, alpine, shrubland, coastal, and riparian wetland habitats. Dozens of volunteers in the state of Texas tirelessly maintain the filters for each county in order to maintain data integrity. The task of creating accurate filters for each of the 254 counties in Texas is extremely difficult for a handful of volunteers and resources are often scattered.

With the help of head Texas eBird editor, Eric Carpenter, I created a tool that uses the current filters and presence absence data from eBird to visualize and monitor these filters for the Texas eBird portal.

This tool currently runs in a SHINY R app that can be run locally on a computer. Just download the entire folder below. Install the necessary packages (noted at the top of the code), enter your working directory, and hit run.
