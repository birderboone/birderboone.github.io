##Meet me at AOS 2018 in Tucson!

I've just got the announcement from the American Ornithologist Society panel that I'll be leading **TWO** events at the conference in Tuscon.

1. Auriel and I will continue the tradition of teaching our R Workshop
**"Taking the Next Step with R: Data Management, Publication Quality Graphics and Function Building‚Äù**
we're taking notes from last year and changing the structure of the workshop a bit. This year we are continuing to teach the the Tidyverse section
and Auriels every popular GGplot course. I am changing up the structure of my portion and focusing on function building with an emphasis on automation.
I hope this will allow students get learn something new and at a pace that will hopefully stick with them.


I'll post the updates as I get them on the Course page.

-Matt
