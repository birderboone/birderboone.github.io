title: What states should you bird in?
---
I've recently moved to San Bernard NWR on the upper Texas coast for some winter rail catching. This refuge boasts some of the highest bird species totals in the United States (a respectable 311). This is partly due to it's location right in the epicenter of spring gulf migration and its proximaty to Houston (1.5 hours). The entire area of the Texas contains impressive  winter birding oppurtunties including being only 40 minutes from the [famous Mad Island WMA](https://www.nature.org/ourinitiatives/regions/northamerica/unitedstates/texas/explore/mad-island-bird-count.xml?redirect=https-301), whose CBC totals rank number one 20 of the past 25 years.

All of this surge in birding and a pronounced increase in free time got me started on a eBird data mining exercise. Some of the first data to come out of this exercise was this curious map. I wanted to see how biased eBird data was to effort. Living in areas with birds usually gets you more birds. This is why species totals tend to be locally maximum around cities. So I mapped all eBird checklists by county and filtered out counties that had totals of atleast 10,000 total.
