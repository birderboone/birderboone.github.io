title: What states should you bird in?
---
I've recently moved to San Bernard NWR on the upper Texas coast for some winter rail catching. This refuge boasts some of the highest bird species totals in the United States (a respectable 311). This is partly due to it's location right in the epicenter of spring gulf migration and its proximaty to Houston (1.5 hours). The entire area of the Texas contains impressive  winter birding oppurtunties including being only 40 minutes from the [famous Mad Island WMA](https://www.nature.org/ourinitiatives/regions/northamerica/unitedstates/texas/explore/mad-island-bird-count.xml?redirect=https-301), whose CBC totals rank number one 20 of the past 25 years.

All of this surge in birding and a pronounced increase in free time got me started on a eBird data mining exercise. Some of the first data to come out of this exercise was an exploration of eBird effort and how it might bias analysis. Living in areas with more birders usually gets you more birds. This is why species totals tend to be locally maximum around cities. My first attempt showed an obvious bias in checklists with population megacenters dominating other regions by factors of ten. So to explore the more under birded areas where effort might become an issue I mapped all eBird checklists by county and filtered out counties that had totals of atleast 1,000 total.

Initial mapping of this showed obvious trends, counties with cities in them are filtered out and populous areas like the Northeast, and areas with low populations few checklists. Disproportionately Mississippii, Kentucky, and West Virgina seem to be under birded even compared to the Great Plains (one of the better known eBird effort holes). How does this total effort effect species seen?

I mapped the total number of species seen all time per state to explore if this effort might be affecting diversity. When looking at this map obvious birding hotspots (Texas, Arizona, and California) stand out easily. These states are all big, south, and contain very diverse habitat including Sky Islands, Deserts, Forests, unique wetlands, and boarding the tropics. Noticeably lacking is the entirety of the Mississippi River drainage and Central Plains. In particular there are obvious biases in ND,SD, NE, AR, MS, KY, and WV. So how many species are we supposed to see in these areas and how underbirded are they?

Part of the USGS Gap Analysis project effort is to calculate likely species richiness across the United States. When we look at maps of avian species richness we notice that species richness increases the farther south and proximate to coastlines. Mountain ranges notoriously lead to less species richiness on a small scale but increase it when paired with novel habitat types (like deserts in the west).
