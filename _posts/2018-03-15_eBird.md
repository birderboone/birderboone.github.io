title: What counties can you find the most new birds in?
---
Recently I asked the question of [what counties were the most underbirded in the county](https://birderboone.github.io/eBirdEffort/). I found that there's a large portion of the country that is under-represented on ebird, particularly the Central and Southern United States.
