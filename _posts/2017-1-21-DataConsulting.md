title: Data Consulting 
---
As a lead up to AOS, I am launching my Consulting services for Biologists.

I am experienced in automating complex data systems, building databases, and creating user interfaces and packages in R for biology groups.
Most labs or non-profits these days have access to more data than they can handle, and often are not fully equipped to manage this data for the long term.
This includes using correct data file structures, databases, and integrated analysis networks (in R for example). 

I am available for consultation on any of your data needs and projects. I have built R packages, widgets, and databases for groups since 2013.

Contact me at [mttboone@gmail.com](mailto:mttboone@gmail.com) for any inquiries on consulting services.
