**LIVE**
Cue blinking lights and marquee

I'm happy to announce the website is up and live. This website is a platform for sharing my code updates as well as an interface to contact me for data and programming consultation for biologists.

I am availble for contracting on any data projects you may have. I also can teach R beginners and advanced courses for you! I excel in automation of data systems for scientists. Ask how I can help your lab/project!
