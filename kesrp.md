**Kauai Endangered Seabird Recovery Project** is an ambitious non-profit located on the island of Kauai, Hawaii. They monitor and research three endangered seabirds that breed on the island, the Newell's Shearwater, Hawaiian Petrel, and Band-rumped Storm-petrel. You can find their homepage [here](http://kauaiseabirdproject.org/)  

During my time as the Database manager and Data analyst I created many useful tools working with Audio Recording units, RECONYX game cameras, and Access databases. This page summarizes these tools. Currently it's links to the codes themselves. 

# Download codes for Audio Recording Units 
Wildlife Acoustic Audio Recording units are cutting edge field based audio recorders used throughout the world. They are highly useful, but can lead to data challenges, particularly when used at high numbers. They create vast amounts of data that needs to be downloaded off of SD cards, organized, summarized, and stored locally. This quick downloader in R, allows you to download from as many local SD card readers as you can manage, organizes their files, and creates a log file to easily manage your data. This code works great for SM2 and SM4 units made by Wildlife Acoustics.
