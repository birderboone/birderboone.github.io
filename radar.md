Weather Radar is a very powerful tool that is used by biologists across the world to track biota. The Aeroecology lab at the University of Delaware, headed by Dr. Jeff Buler, analyzes weather radars to answer important questions about Avian Stopover and movement ecology. During my Masters in the Aeroecology Lab, I packages and functions in R to help take raw radar data and analyze it. This package includes many useful codes including analyze take off times of birds at night, beam characteristic calculators, and creating Vertically Integrated Radar Profiles.

# Radar
Currently this is a repository for my radar package. This large package has so many novel intricacies it will take a while to summarize them all outside of the included help file. The radar package can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/birderboone/Radar), and loaded locally.  

Be prepared for the page to grow as I expand on the packages power.
